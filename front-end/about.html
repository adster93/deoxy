This app is built off of the human genome project. Reports were taken from submissions by 23andme participants.

The original site had very low loading speeds because it was running on an outdated web framework. I thought this would be a great time to put my Biology degree and software development skills to the test.

Using the scraped data, I used SVGs and D3 to display this data in an aesthetic and interactive way. The data can and will be constantly updated as long as the public genome project database continutes to update as well. All that is needed is to create a mongodb, create a database named deoxy with a collection called genes, and run the scraper with node genome_scrape.js.

Enjoy!
